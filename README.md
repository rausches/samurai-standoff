# Samurai Standoff
This is a side project I came up with to pass time. The idea was to create something with simplistic controls akin to Flappy Bird that puts the player into a "trance." This was also a good opportunity to develop skills drawing pixel art and javascript implementation. The plan is to deploy this project as an app for mobile phones and to be fully functional offline.

The controls and goal of this game are simple. The second you see the glint of your enemy's blade is the moment he lets his guard down--and for you to land a devastating counterattack. Defeat as many opponents as possible in a duel-like setting!
